              <h6>Towards the Plurinational Bayesian Congress 2023</h6>

              During the year 2023, before meeting in person in Santiago del Estero, we will hold a virtual seminar with the participation of the most diverse profiles of the Plurinational Bayesian Community. Everything will be uploaded on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bayesdelsur">youtube</a>. If you want to participate, send an email to bayesdelsur@gmail.com.

              Seminar.

              <h5>"Intersubjective agreements in contexts of uncertainty: life bets."</h5>

<p>
Science is a human institution that seeks truths: intersubjective agreements with intercultural (or universal) validity.
The formal sciences (mathematics, logic) reach these agreements by deriving theorems within closed axiomatic systems.
However, the empirical sciences (from physics to the social sciences) must validate their propositions within open systems that always contain some degree of uncertainty.
Is it then possible to reach intersubjective agreements (``truths'') in the empirical sciences if it is inevitable to say ``I don't know''?
Yes.
In short, we can avoid lying: not say more than what is known while incorporating all the available information.
</p>
<p>

For example, suppose we know that there is one gift hidden behind a box among three.
Where is the gift?
It is in one of the three boxes, but we don't know in which one.
If we choose any of the boxes we would be stating more than we know, because we have no information that would make us prefer any of them.
In this case, where we have no further information, we will agree on the need to divide belief into equal parts.
By maximizing uncertainty we avoid saying more than we know, allowing us to reach a first intersubjective agreement in contexts of uncertainty!
Great. But then, how do we preserve this intersubjective agreement if we receive new information?

</p>
<p>

The logic of uncertainty (probability theory) has been repeatedly derived from different principles (axioms), always arriving at the same two simple rules.
The \emph{sum rule} ensures that we do not lose belief when we distribute it among mutually contradictory hypotheses: by adding up how much we assign to each hypothesis, we recover the initial 100%.
And the (conditional or) \emph{product rule}, guarantees the coherence of beliefs with the available information: when we observe new data we preserve the prior belief that is still compatible with it (and the surviving belief is our new 100%).
Unlike ad-hoc approaches that select a single hypothesis (e.g. by maximum likelihood), the strict application of probability rules (Bayesian approach), by believing at the same time in mutually contradictory hypotheses (A and not A), allows surprise, the only source of information, to be the sole filter of prior beliefs.
</p>
<p>
The value of truth is not abstract, it is pragmatic.
The ``lie'' is a cross-cultural concept and its negation ``not to lie'' is a principle present in all societies of the world not because there is a striking coincidence between different particular moral criteria, but because truth has a concrete practical value, which is universal.
The Bayesian selection process of alternative hypotheses (based on the sequence of surprises) is, like the evolutionary selection process (sequence of reproduction and survival rates), of a multiplicative nature.
Because in them the impacts of losses are stronger than those of gains (for example, a single zero in the sequence produces an irreversible extinction) there is an advantage in favor of variants (hypotheses or life forms) that reduce fluctuations.
This multiplicative structure of both selection processes has concrete consequences for life and knowledge.
</p>
<p>

Since its origin, life has acquired an extraordinary complexity in terms of diversification, cooperation, specialization and coexistence.
Why does that happen?
First, diversification makes it possible to individually reduce fluctuations in multiplicative processes.
This property allows probability theory to acquire knowledge about the world, because evaluating individual hypotheses on the basis of the product of surprises produces an advantage in favor of hypotheses that diversify resources (probabilities) in the same proportion as the observed frequency.
Moreover, through cooperation fluctuations are further reduced, allowing higher level hypotheses (causal models, paradigms) to ``emerge'' from the data because, by making predictions with the contribution of all its component hypotheses, it produces better results than any of them alone.
And finally, since with cooperation it is no longer necessary to reduce fluctuations by individual diversification, an advantage in favor of specialization arises producing the emergence of worldviews, such as science and culture, where highly specialized domain-specific paradigms coexist.
</p>
<p>
In the same way, the multiplicative selection of life (by sequences of reproduction and survival rates) has produced throughout its history a series of evolutionary transitions in which entities capable of self-replication after the transition became part of an indissoluble cooperative unit.
Our own life depends on several levels of cooperation (with specialization), without which we are not able to survive: the union of our cells with mitochondria and the emergence of organelles; our multicellular organism and the emergence of organs; our society and the emergence of roles and groups; the coexistence between species and the emergence of ecosystems.
For our species, the emergence of mutual understanding produced a radical change.
Before the cultural transition, we were in serious danger of extinction, as evidenced by the low diversity of the human genome.
But when knowledge, that previously had to be rediscovered individually, became a common resource passed on from generation to generation, we were able to occupy all the ecological niches of the earth as no other terrestrial vertebrate had done before.
</p>
<p>

The emergence of higher level units is a permanent phenomenon in the history of life and knowledge because, under multiplicative selection processes, the defecting variants negatively affect their own long-term growth rate: this behavior, by increasing the fluctuations on whom it depends (the cooperators), also increases their own fluctuations.
The experience accumulated by the most diverse communities in the world has led, independently, to a universal obligation to give and receive, and to the development of technologies of reciprocity that maintain cohesion by re-activating community bonds through (festive or coercive) exchange rites.
In turn, the technologies of ecological reciprocity produced the independent emergence of domestication of animals and plants, the development of special genetic traits that arise as a result of prolonged symbiotic interaction between species.
</p>
<p>
Agriculture developed in parallel in the six geographic systems of the earth (sub-Saharan Africa, Wester Asia, China, Oceania, North America and South America), creating the main population and technological centers of humanity.
During the 1400s, prosperous societies flourished around the world.
The Pacific Ocean was already fully occupied, and there had already been exchanges between Oceania and South America, which is evident in the genetics of current populations.
China was still the main productive and technological center of the world after two thousand years, and in the Arab world these products were traded from the Pacific Ocean in the Philippines to the Atlantic Ocean in Spain.
And in the center of human genetic and cultural diversity, sub-Saharan Africa, the Bantu society developed among others.
</p>
<p>
The breakdown of the cooperative pact negatively affects those who promote it without the need to introduce punishments.
After the massive destruction of the cultural diversity produced by the Roman Empire, Western Europe entered, against the rest of the world, into a long process of cultural involution and internal violence known as the ``Middle Ages''.
Like any society that lives in a terrible socioeconomic situation, as soon as feudal Europe discovers how to navigate the Atlantic, a massive migratory process begins.
The coincidence of a series of events placed this historically marginal society in a situation of worldwide privilege.
A century earlier, China had incorporated silver as one of its official currencies, and the massive arrival of feudal immigrants to South America produced a series of epidemics that decimated its population.
But the geopolitical shift did not occur until feudal explorers discovered the silver mountain of Potosi in 1546: 25 years later feudal Europe dominated the Mediterranean (battle of Lepanto) and the cycle of foreign technology imports began, mainly from China.
</p>
<p>
Even during the 1800s, after the American independences, Western Europe still had a trade deficit with China, which since the mid-1700s had been financed in part by the opium drug trade.
The consequences were more severe when a cheaper and more potent opium mixture was developed in 1818.
The number of addicts became alarming, and in 1839 China made the mistake of declaring war against the British narco-state in its own territory.
The results were terrible: China lost 1/5 of its population and was subjected to foreign invasions for a century.
It was only after the defeat of China that Western Europe began in 1850 to occupy Africa and the still autonomous territories of America.
The era of genocide and massive loss of cultural diversity begins.
</p>
<p>
Just as the decadence of feudal society was preceded by a massive loss of cultural diversity in the region of the Roman Empire, the current ecological crisis has been preceded by a massive loss of global cultural diversity.
Despite all the advances, metropolitan science was not able to compensate for the loss of millenarian knowledge caused by colonial-modernity and as a consequence the ecological crisis continues to deepen.
The advantage in favor of diversification and cooperation is not only theoretical, its breakdown has consequences for life and knowledge.
Just as the problem of overfitting is a direct consequence of selecting a single hypothesis, the current ecological crisis is a direct consequence of the imposition of a single type of society.
In the long term, only variants capable of reducing fluctuations through diversification and cooperation survive.
</p>
<p>
Just as the Bayesian approach adapts knowledge by believing at the same time in A and non-A, a Plurinational society adapts to life through reciprocal coexistence between autonomous communities.

              <h6><a href="https://github.com/Grupo-de-modelado-probabilista/Modelado_Bayesiano">Bayesian Modeling Course</a><a id="Modelado_Bayesiano">.</a>From 28/11/2022 to 02/12/2022</h6>
              <p>This is an introductory course for people with no prior knowledge of statistics or data science. Familiarity with Python and Python libraries used in data analysis such as Numpy, matplotlib, Pandas, etc. is assumed.
              </p>
              <p>
              Those who don't know Python but are familiar with other programming languages will also be able to take advantage of the course, although you may experience a little more friction.
              </p>
              <p>
              Finally, those who are not interested in learning how to code for data analysis can still take advantage of some of the material to get a bird's-eye view of Bayesian methods.

              <h6>Seminar <a href="https://www.conicet.gov.ar/oportunidades-y-becas/publicacion/344/congresosseminarios/">Causal models and equity in machine learning</a><a id="#fairness">.</a> Start on 10/19/2022</h6>
              <p>The Department of Computing of the Faculty of Engineering (UBA) invites you to participate in this series of seminars.</p>
              <p>
              The application of machine learning models for decision-making that affects people can help put an end to discriminatory episodes carried out by certain agents thanks to the automation of decision processes. However, it also raises ethical issues due to the possibility that algorithmic bias ends up reinforcing certain historical inequalities.
              </p>
              <p>
              The study of the implications of the use of machine learning technologies in social contexts has given rise to an area of study known as Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (FAT). Through these seminars we seek to promote a space for discussion and debate on this topic of social relevance, and stimulate possible applications and studies related to it.</p>
